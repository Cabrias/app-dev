# Pacific Rim
Pacific Rim is a 2013 science fiction monster film directed by Guillermo del Toro, starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman, and the first film in the Pacific Rim franchise. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju,[a] colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.

Principal photography began on November 14, 2011, in Toronto and lasted through to April 2012. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. It was released on July 12, 2013, in 3D and IMAX 3D, receiving generally positive reviews; the visual effects, action sequences, and nostalgic style were highly praised. While it underperformed at the box office in the United States, it was highly successful in other markets, thus becoming a box office success. It earned a worldwide total of more than $411 million—earning $114 million in China alone, its largest market—becoming Del Toro's most commercially successful film. The film is regarded as a homage to kaiju, mecha, and anime media.

A sequel titled Pacific Rim Uprising was released on March 23, 2018, with Universal Pictures distributing.

# Plot 
In 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional portal called "The Breach" at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and attacking coastal cities. In response, humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers. Each is co-piloted by two or more people who share a mental link by a process called "Drifting" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.

In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the American Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed Knifehead. The Kaiju unexpectedly pierces the Jaeger's armor, ripping out half of its head and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the damaged Jaeger solo, kills Knifehead and walks Gipsy to shore before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of his brother and the stress of piloting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.

Five years later, world leaders decide to cease funding for the Jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, since Kaiju are appearing more frequently and Jaegers are being destroyed as quickly as they are built. The walls are quickly proven to be ineffective. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under the command of Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to try to destroy the Breach using a tactical nuclear weapon, even though previous attempts to do so have failed.

Raleigh, now working in wall construction, is recruited by Pentecost for the mission. Travelling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the director of the Jaeger restoration program and Pentecost's adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation – the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, the Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka, piloted by father-and-son team, Herc and Chuck Hansen. To find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts and decides that Mako is "drift-compatible". During their first test, Raleigh falls out of alignment after reliving Yancy's death, causing Mako to become lost in the memory of a Kaiju attack on Tokyo, nearly firing Gipsy's energy cannon. As a result, Pentecost grounds Mako.

Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed. Newton suggests attempting to drift with a Kaiju's brain to learn more about them but is dismissed by his colleagues. He tries it regardless, discovering that Kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. Pentecost instructs Newton to find black market dealer Hannibal Chau to obtain another Kaiju brain to drift with. Newton realizes the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and the two newest Kaiju to emerge, Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him in Hong Kong.

All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger are dispatched to intervene. The Kaijus destroy Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha, while Leatherback disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast, also injuring Herc. As the only non-digital Jaeger, Pentecost sends the nuclear-powered Gipsy Danger to help. Gipsy manages to defeat Leatherback and Otachi. Newton and Hannibal go to harvest Otachi's secondary brain but discover she is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal before choking on its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering that the Breach only opens in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.

Pentecost reveals to Raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation Jaeger, which lacked radiation shielding. His last mission was in Tokyo, where he saved a young Mako but piloted alone. Two new Kaiju are detected guarding the Breach, prompting Gipsy and the repaired Striker, piloted by Pentecost and Chuck, to go ahead with the assault. Approaching the Breach, the Jaegers are attacked by the Kaiju alongside a new Category-5 Kaiju, Slattern, leading to Striker being crippled. Pentecost and Chuck decide to sacrifice Striker while Gipsy acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the Breach. After Striker self-destructs, Gipsy slaughters Slattern, riding its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from Gipsy, manually triggers Gipsy's self-destruct, and ejects himself before it explodes and seals the Breach. Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean; they embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.
